# 🌴 Hey there, I'm Laxman 🤝
I'm a Computer Vision Engineer at Hammoq 👨‍💻 who loves to explore anything that interests me. I love to know why and how things work under the hood, this encourages and excites me to dig deep into certain topics. Learning something new gives me a thrill and this has always been my driving force.

- I can code in C++, Python, Javascript, Django, React, Node, MATLAB.
- I'm a competetive coder too.
- I'm an ML guy. I don't just want to code off a snippet, I want to know what's the crux of those lines of code. This made me learn a bit of maths.
- Now, I'm working in Deep Learning area for the past 3 years and I am very passionate and eager to contribute to deep learning community.
- I'm also an open source contributor. I believe open source is something we should be thankful where people work day and night without expecting profit. I'd love to be a part of this system and do my best to help my favourite projects.
